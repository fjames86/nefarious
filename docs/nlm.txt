Network Lock Manager Protocol

Introduction

The Network Lock Manager (NLM) is a service that provides advisory X/Open CAE file and record locking, and DOS compatible file sharing and locking in an XNFS environment. Here, DOS refers to MS-DOS or PC DOS, and DOS file sharing and record locking is as defined in Disk Operating System Technical Reference, IBM part no. 6138536.

Versions

There are multiple versions of the NLM. This document describes version 3 which is backward compatible with versions 1 and 2.

Synchronization of NLMs

Due to the stateless nature of XNFS servers it is difficult to incorporate a stateful service. The NLM relies on the server holding the locks as the keeper of the state and on the NSM for information on host status (monitored locks only). When an XNFS server crashes and is rebooted, locks which it had granted may be recreated by the lock holders (clients) during a grace period. During this grace period no new locks are accepted although NFS requests are accepted. The duration of this grace period is implementation-dependent; 45 seconds is common.

DOS-Compatible File-Sharing Support

Version 3 of the protocol supports DOS compatible file locking and sharing. File sharing is a mechanism which allows a DOS process to open or create a file and to restrict the way in which subsequent processes may access the file. For example, a DOS client may request that a file is opened for reading and writing, and that subsequent users may only open it for reading. To use a DOS sharing mode an NLM_SHARE request is issued when a file is opened, and a corresponding NLM_UNSHARE is performed when it is closed. These procedures rely on the nlm_share structure, defined below. Because the sharing requests were intended to be used by a single-tasking client host, they are non-monitored.

RPC Information

Authentication

The NLM service uses AUTH_UNIX style authentication only.

Transport Protocols

The NLM Protocol supports both UDP/IP and TCP/IP transports. However, a client implementation may choose to only generate requests over the UDP/IP protocol.

Port Number

Consult the server's port mapper, described in Port Mapper Protocol , to find the port number on which the NLM service is registered.

Sizes of XDR Structures

These are the sizes, given in decimal bytes, of various XDR structures used in the protocol.

 

/* The maximum length of the string identifying the caller. */
const LM_MAXSTRLEN = 1024;

/* The maximum number of bytes in the nlm_notify name argument. */
const LM_MAXNAMELEN = LM_MAXSTRLEN+1;

const MAXNETOBJ_SZ = 1024;


Basic Data Types for Locking

The following XDR definitions are the basic structures and types used in the parameters passed to, and returned from, the NLM.

netobj

  

opaque netobj<MAXNETOBJ_SZ>


Netobj is used to identify an object, generally a transaction, owner or file. The contents and form of the netobj are defined by the client.

nlm_stats

  

enum nlm_stats {
    LCK_GRANTED = 0,
    LCK_DENIED = 1,
    LCK_DENIED_NOLOCKS = 2,
    LCK_BLOCKED = 3,
    LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD = 4
};


Nlm_stats are returned whenever the NLM is called upon to create or test a lock on a file.

LCK_GRANTED
Indicates that the procedure call completed successfully.
LCK_DENIED
Indicates that the request failed.
LCK_DENIED_NOLOCKS

Indicates that the procedure call failed because the server NLM could not allocate the resources needed to process the request.
LCK_BLOCKED
Indicates the blocking request cannot be granted immediately. The server NLM will make a call-back to the client with an NLM_GRANTED procedure call when the lock can be granted.
LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD

Indicates that the procedure call failed because the server has recently been rebooted and the server NLM is re-establishing existing locks, and is not yet ready to accept normal service requests.
Note that some versions of NFS source may use mixed or lower-case names for the enumeration constants in "nlm_stats".

nlm_stat

  

struct nlm_stat {
    nlm_stats stat;
};


This structure returns lock status. It is used in many of the other data structures.

nlm_res

  

struct nlm_res {
    netobj cookie;
    nlm_stat stat;
};


The nlm_res structure is returned by all of the main lock routines except for NLM_TEST which has a separate return structure defined below. Note that clients must not rely upon the "cookie" being the same as that passed in the corresponding request.

nlm_holder

  

struct nlm_holder {
    bool exclusive;
    int uppid;
    netobj oh;
    unsigned l_offset;
    unsigned l_len;
};


The nlm_holder structure identifies the holder of a particular lock. It is used as part of the return value from the NLM_TEST procedure. The boolean "exclusive" indicates whether the lock is exclusively held by the current holder. The integer "uppid" provides a unique per-process identifier for lock differentiation. The values "l_offset" and "l_len" define the region of the file locked by this holder. The "oh" field is an opaque object that identifies the host, or a process on the host, that is holding the lock.

nlm_testrply

  

union nlm_testrply switch (nlm_stats stat) {
    case LCK_DENIED:
        struct nlm_holder holder;    /*  holder of the lock */
    default:
        void;
};


The nlm_testrply is used as part of the return value from the NLM_TEST procedure. If the lock specified in the NLM_TEST procedure call would conflict with a previously granted lock, information on the holder of the lock is returned in "holder", otherwise just the status is returned.

nlm_testres

  

struct nlm_testres {
    netobj cookie;
    nlm_testrply test_stat;
};


This structure is the return value from the NLM_TEST procedure. The other main lock routines return the nlm_res structure.

nlm_lock

  

struct nlm_lock {
    string caller_name<LM_MAXSTRLEN>;
    netobj fh;         /*  identify a file  */
    netobj oh;         /*  identify owner of a lock  */
    int uppid;         /*  Unique process identifier  */
    unsigned l_offset; /*  File offset (for record locking) */
    unsigned l_len;    /*  Length (size of record)  */
};


The nlm_lock structure defines the information needed to uniquely specify a lock. The "caller_name" uniquely identifies the host making the call. The "fh" field identifies the file to lock. The "oh" field is an opaque object that identifies the host, or a process on the host, that is making the request. "uppid" uniquely describes the process owning the file on the calling host. The "uppid" may be generated in any system-dependent fashion. On an X/Open-compliant system it is generally the process ID. On a DOS system it may be generated from the program segment prefix (PSP). The "l_offset" and "l_len" determine which bytes of the file are locked.

nlm_lockargs

  

struct nlm_lockargs {
    netobj cookie;
    bool block;            /*  Flag to indicate blocking behaviour. */
    bool exclusive;        /*  If exclusive access is desired. */
    struct nlm_lock alock; /*  The actual lock data (see above) */
    bool reclaim;          /*  used for recovering locks  */
    int state;             /*  specify local NSM state  */
};


The nlm_lockargs structure defines the information needed to request a lock on a server. The "block" field must be set to true if the client wishes the procedure call to block until the lock can be granted (see NLM_LOCK). A false value will cause the procedure call to return immediately if the lock cannot be granted. The "reclaim" field must only be set to true if the client is attempting to reclaim a lock held by an NLM which has been restarted (due to a server crash, and so on). The "state" field is used with the monitored lock procedure call (NLM_LOCK). It is the state value supplied by the local NSM, see Network Status Monitor Protocol .

nlm_cancargs

  

struct nlm_cancargs {
    netobj cookie;        
    bool block;
    bool exclusive;
    struct nlm_lock alock;
};


The nlm_cancargs structure defines the information needed to cancel an outstanding lock request. The data in the nlm_cancargs structure must exactly match the corresponding information in the nlm_lockargs structure of the outstanding lock request to be cancelled.

nlm_testargs

  

struct nlm_testargs {
    netobj cookie;        
    bool exclusive;
    struct nlm_lock alock;
};


The nlm_testargs structure defines the information needed to test a lock. The information in this structure is the same as the corresponding fields in the nlm_lockargs structure.

nlm_unlockargs

  

struct nlm_unlockargs {
    netobj cookie;        
    struct nlm_lock alock;
};


The nlm_unlockargs structure defines the information needed to remove a previously established lock.

DOS File-Sharing Data Types

The following data types are used in version 3 of the NLM to support DOS 3.1 and above compatible file-sharing control. All file-sharing procedure calls are non-monitored.

fsh_mode

  

enum fsh_mode {
    fsm_DN = 0,        /*  deny none  */
    fsm_DR = 1,        /*  deny read  */
    fsm_DW = 2,        /*  deny write  */
    fsm_DRW = 3        /*  deny read/write  */
};


fsh_mode defines the legal sharing modes.

fsh_access

  

enum fsh_access {
    fsa_NONE = 0,     /*  for completeness  */
    fsa_R = 1,        /*  read-only  */
    fsa_W = 2,        /*  write-only  */
    fsa_RW = 3        /*  read/write  */
};


fsh_access defines the legal file access modes.

nlm_share

  

struct nlm_share {
    string caller_name<LM_MAXSTRLEN>;
    netobj fh;
    netobj oh;
    fsh_mode mode;
    fsh_access access;
};


The nlm_share structure defines the information needed to uniquely specify a share operation. The netobj's define the file. "fh" and owner "oh", "caller_name" uniquely identifies the host. "mode" and "access" define the file-sharing and the access modes.

nlm_shareargs

  

struct nlm_shareargs {
    netobj cookie;
    nlm_share share;     /*  actual share data  */
    bool reclaim;        /*  used for recovering shares  */
};


This structure encodes the arguments for an NLM_SHARE or NLM_UNSHARE procedure call. The boolean "reclaim" must be true if the client is attempting to reclaim a previously-granted sharing request, and false otherwise.

nlm_shareres

  

struct nlm_shareres {
    netobj cookie;
    nlm_stats stat;
    int sequence;
};


This structure encodes the results of an NLM_SHARE or NLM_UNSHARE procedure call. The "cookie" and "sequence" fields should be ignored; they are required only for compatibility reasons. The result of the request is given by "stat".

nlm_notify

  

struct nlm_notify {
    string name<LM_MAXNAMELEN>;
    long state;
};


This structure encodes the arguments for releasing all locks and shares a client holds.

NLM Procedures

The following reference pages define the protocol used by the NLM using RPC Language. Version 3 of the protocol is the same as version 1 and 2 with the addition of the non-monitored locking procedures and the DOS compatible sharing procedures.

 

/*
 * NLM procedures
 */

program NLM_PROG {
    version NLM_VERSX {
        /*
         *  synchronous procedures
         */
        void         NLM_NULL(void) = 0;
        nlm_testres  NLM_TEST(struct nlm_testargs) = 1;
        nlm_res      NLM_LOCK(struct nlm_lockargs) = 2;
        nlm_res      NLM_CANCEL(struct nlm_cancargs) = 3;
        nlm_res      NLM_UNLOCK(struct nlm_unlockargs) = 4;

        /*
         *  server   NLM call-back procedure to grant lock
         */
        nlm_res      NLM_GRANTED(struct nlm_testargs) = 5;

        /*
         *  asynchronous requests and responses
         */
        void         NLM_TEST_MSG(struct nlm_testargs) = 6;
        void         NLM_LOCK_MSG(struct nlm_lockargs) = 7;
        void         NLM_CANCEL_MSG(struct nlm_cancargs) =8;
        void         NLM_UNLOCK_MSG(struct nlm_unlockargs) = 9;
        void         NLM_GRANTED_MSG(struct nlm_testargs) = 10;
        void         NLM_TEST_RES(nlm_testres) = 11;
        void         NLM_LOCK_RES(nlm_res) = 12;
        void         NLM_CANCEL_RES(nlm_res) = 13;
        void         NLM_UNLOCK_RES(nlm_res) = 14;
        void         NLM_GRANTED_RES(nlm_res) = 15;

        /*
         *  synchronous non-monitored lock and DOS file-sharing
         *  procedures (not defined for version 1 and 2)
         */
        nlm_shareres NLM_SHARE(nlm_shareargs) = 20;
        nlm_shareres NLM_UNSHARE(nlm_shareargs) = 21;
        nlm_res      NLM_NM_LOCK(nlm_lockargs) = 22;
        void         NLM_FREE_ALL(nlm_notify) = 23;
    } = 3;
} = 100021;


The NLM provides synchronous and asynchronous procedures which provide the same functionality. The client portion of an NLM may choose to implement locking and file-sharing functionality by using either set of procedure calls.

The server portion of an NLM implementation must support both the synchronous and asynchronous procedures.

The asynchronous procedures implement a message passing scheme to facilitate asynchronous handling of locking and unlocking. Each of the functions Test, Lock, Unlock and Grant is broken up into a message part, and a result part. An NLM will send a message to another NLM to perform some action. The receiving NLM will queue the request, and when it is dequeued and completed, will send the appropriate result via the result procedure. For example an NLM may send an NLM_LOCK_MSG and will expect an NLM_LOCK_RES in return. These functions have the same functionality and parameters as the synchronous procedures.

Note that most NLM implementations do not send RPC-layer replies to asynchronous procedures. When a client sends an NLM_LOCK_MSG call, for example, it should not expect an RPC reply with the corresponding xid. Instead, it must expect an NLM_LOCK_RES call from the server. The server should not expect an RPC reply to the NLM_LOCK_RES call.
